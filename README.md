# Milestone Project 1 - Silver Street
## Purpose
This fictional website was created to complete the first Milestone Project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Developer course.
I built this from the ground up using knowledge I gained from the previous modules. These being HTML, CSS and User Centric Design. The full list of technologies used can be found in the technologies section further down.

You can find the link to the live website right [here](https://jrdnbrkfld.github.io/pp1-silver-street/).

This fictional website was created to spread awareness for the venue. The website can be used to promote and advertise all of the venues activities and events that are taking place. This would increase sales and public knowledge.
